MacOS keyboard shortcut scripts for Udemy playback control in a background window

The three Apple Scripts will search for a browser tab with a Udemy course and perform an action (e.g., play/pause, rewind 5 seconds, or fast forward 5 second).
Binding the scripts to a macropad or keyboard button allows the focus to remain on your current window (e.g., a note taking app) while controlling and watching a Udemy class in another window or tab.

## Instructions (assuming you're using a Logitech Keyboard)
Logitech's Logi Options+ allows you to create custom keyboard shortcuts that open an application.
1. Open each file with Apple's Script Editor.
2. Export each script to an application in the Script Editor.
3. Using Logi Options+, for each exported application, assign it to a key by selecting "open Application" and selecting the desired action for the key.
